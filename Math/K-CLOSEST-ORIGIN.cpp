// Problem Statement :
// Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
// The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
// You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

// Example 1;

// Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
// Output: [[-2,2]]
// Explanation:
// The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
// The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
// Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
// We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].


// Example 2:

// Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
// Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
// Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

// Time Complexity:

// Building the priority queue using the range constructor takes O(N log N) time, where N is the number of points.
// Retrieving the top K points from the priority queue takes O(K log N) time.
// Overall, the time complexity of the kClosest function is O(N log N + K log N), which simplifies to O((N + K) log N) in the worst case.
// Space Complexity:

// The space complexity of the code is O(N) because the priority queue stores N points, and the ans vector stores K points.
// The size of the priority queue is determined by the number of points, so it contributes O(N) space.
// The ans vector stores K points, so it contributes O(K) space.
// Therefore, the total space complexity is O(N + K).
// Note: The time and space complexities mentioned here are based on the provided code.
